> If you can't teach it then you might not know it well enough.

Every few days I've discovered a new cursorless command or a new way to use a command. I decided to formalize my learning by writing it down into a set of notes and small exercises that others can use.

It may be the basis for something more formal within the Cursorless repo, or it may just remain notes.
