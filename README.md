# Motivation

> If you can't teach it, you might not know it

Every few days I discovered a new command or a novel way to chain commands and scopes. The exercises and challenges listed below are my effort to formalize my learning by writing it down. Hopefully others will benefit from these exercises too.

It may be the basis for something more formal within the Cursorless repo, or it may just remain in this [repo](https://github.com/Will-Sommers/cursorless-katas).

# Katas

If you are a beginner, start with [Actions](./katas/actions/). This section begins with a gentle introduction to navigating and editing before jumping into more complex actions. From there, head to [Language Scopes, a representative subset](./katas/language_scopes/README.md) and then [Paired Delimiters](./katas/paired_delimiters/README.md). Next head to [Compound Targets](./katas/compound_targets/README.md).

If you are a little more familiar with Cursorless, consider starting from [Actions](./katas/actions/) anyway. If you're not inclined here are a few interesting sections.

- [Inference](./katas/modifiers/scope_inference/README.md)
- [Just](./katas/modifiers/just/README.md)
- [Paint](./katas/special_scopes/paint/README.md)
- [Slice](./katas/modifiers/slice/README.md)
