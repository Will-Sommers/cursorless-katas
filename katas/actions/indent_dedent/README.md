# Indent & Dedent

This will be pretty self explanatory with one caveat, discussed after the example.

Open [indentDedent.js](./indentDedent.js) and put your cursor on line 2.

> Say `"indent"` or `"indent this"`

Try it now with a `<mark>`. Finally, rounding up, with your cursor still on line 2.

> Say `"indent funk"`

Play around with both `"indent"` and `"dedent"` paired with marks and scopes in your favorite language.

The one caveat related to this is that it may make sense to not worry much about indentation, if your language doesn't require it to define function scope. Instead, rely on a code style plugin to clean up your file, either on save, close or paste.
