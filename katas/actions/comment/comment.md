# Reformatting text

The `"comment"` command is used to comment a whole row. Pop into the accompanying `comment_example.rb` and try to comment out this line:

```
This is an example of addition in Ruby
```

Look for any mark within that line and then

> Say `"comment <mark>"`

The line should be commented out and we should have a valid Ruby program again. ğŸ™Œ
