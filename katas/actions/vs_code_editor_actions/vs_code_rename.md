Ok, great! Let's work on renaming now. This will change the name of all occurrences of a symbol within a file. You may need to have a Ruby plugin, such as [Solargraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph). This requires a gem to be installed as well. If that is too much, try `"rename"` in the language you're most set up with.

Look at the mark you'd like to rename, let's try a mark above HelloWorld

> Say `"rename <mark>"`

You'll observe an input box pop up next to the mark. You can enter the new name there.
