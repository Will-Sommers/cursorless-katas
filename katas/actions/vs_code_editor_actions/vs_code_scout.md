# VSCode Editor Actions

Ok, up until this point, we were looking at Ruby within a Markdown file. As of 4/20/22, Cursorsless does not support multi-language documents. For this exercise, have `example.rb` open as well.

Now, let's try using the `"scout"` command to open the find dropdown. Move your active cursor to be anywhere within the `example.rb` file, try using the `"pre <mark>"` command.

Now, for `"scout"`. Look at any mark over any word.

> Say `"scout <mark>"`

You'll notice the token you `"scout"`-ed is now in a find dropdown for the file.

> Say `"scout all <mark>"`

You'll notice the sidebar pop open with the mark's token added.
