# VSCode Editor Actions

Ok, let's move to the next file and open `example2.rb`.

Let's start by using the `"hover"` action. This bring up the docstring for a class or function. Find the mark above `say_hi`.

> Say `"hover <mark>"`

You'll observe the docstring in a small tooltil next to `a.say_hi`.

Let's look at the function itself.

> Say `"define <mark>"`

This should have moved you back to the `example.rb` file. As stated before, this relies on a Ruby extension being isntalled. If you're having trouble, try this in a language you use every day.
