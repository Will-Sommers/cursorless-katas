# Sort, Reverse, Shuffle

This should be short and sweet.

##### Exercise 1

Let's start by sorting the first list. Place using a mark or your cursor position,

> Say `"sort every item"` or `"sort every item <mark>"`

Looks sort of funny, 11 comes before 3? That's because currently everything is sorted as a string. Now, sort the list on the next line as well. Now that you have a sorted list, let's reverse it.

> Say `"reverse every item"`

Finally, let's reshuffle it.

> Say `"shuffle every item"`

##### Exercise 2

Take a look at the map. Let's first sort the items.

> Say `"sort every item"`

Now, with the items sorted, try issuing `shuffle` but only on the values. What happens? The key stays the same but the values change. This is probably not what you want in most cases.

If you want to keep `"key"` and `"value"` paired together, make sure to use the `"item"` scope.
