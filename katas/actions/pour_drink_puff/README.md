# Pour, Drink, Puff

The "It's Saturday Night" of actions. We'll split this section into two pieces. `"drink"` and `"pour"` are used to insert lines, either above or below the mark, respectively. They can be used with either an implicit mark.

Put your cursor on line 1 of the [pourDrinkPuff.js](./pourDrinkPuff.js) file.

> Say `"pour"`

You can also pair it with `"this"`.

> Say `"pour this"`

You can also pair it with a mark

> Say `"pour <mark>"`

Now try adding a line above, using `"drink"`.

Onto `"puff"`. This action also adds lines, in this case, a line above and below the target. However, the cursor position is not altered.

Put your cursor on line 1 of the [pourDrinkPuff.js](./pourDrinkPuff.js) file.

> Say `"puff this"`

Notice that the cursor remains in the same place and a line has been added above and below where the cursor is.
