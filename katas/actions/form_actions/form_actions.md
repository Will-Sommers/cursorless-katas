# Reformatting text

The `"form"` command allows cursorless to take one type of text formatting, kebab-case-formatting, for example and reformat it. This relies on your `<user.formatters>` which are defined by default if you are using knausj. The `<format>`name will be defined in your Talon config files, outside of Cursorless config.

The command is used as such:

`"form <format> at <mark>"`

Pop into the accompanying `form_example.rb` and try to format the line as kebab case.

> Say `"form kebab at <mark>"`

Try out the different types of formatting you might know. A few examples are "camel", "hammer", "snake", and "kebab".
