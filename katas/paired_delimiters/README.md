# Paired Delimiters

Although `"wrap"` and `"repack"` are both actions, I've pulled them out into the section related to paired delimiters. If you're not familiar with all of the paired delimiters, check out the [docs](https://www.cursorless.org/docs/#paired-delimiters).

First, check out [Inside and Bound](../modifiers/inside_bound/) to see how how to address the delimiter and its content separately.

- [Wrap with delimiters](./wrap)
- [Repack delimiters](./repack)
