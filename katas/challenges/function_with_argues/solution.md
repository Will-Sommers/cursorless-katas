### Function with Args

As noted in the challenge, you could have your cursor positioned below the comma and say

> `"bring funk <mark>"` > `"chuck argue <mark>"`

Let's try it another way though. You can write the function your talon defaults. I said `"funk sayHello"`. Finally I can address the marks over the first and third arguments with the `"bring"` action and then bring them to the empty parenthesis.

> `"bring argue <mark> and <mark> to after just <mark>"`
> e.g. `"bring argue near and each to after just leper"`

Voila. Thank you to @pokey for this one.
