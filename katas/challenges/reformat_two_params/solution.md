### Solution

There are often cases where we make the wrong selection or want every selection apart from one. This is a good place to use `"give"`.

Starting with every parameter selected, you can say `"give <mark>"` to remove the mark above the second parameter. From there, you can reformat the first and third using `"form snake at this"`.
