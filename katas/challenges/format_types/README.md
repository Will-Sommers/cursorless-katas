### Format Types

Take a look at the [formatTypes.ts](formatTypes.ts) file.

Assume you can't see the end of the list, so don't address any hats above tokens at the end of the list.

Now, try to wrap each state in double quotes, separate the strings by a `"|"` character and then follow the last member of the union by a semi-colon.
