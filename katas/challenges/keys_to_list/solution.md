### Solution

Clone the map to preserve the original. Now, address the cloned map and remove every value by saying:

> `"chuck every value"`

You'll now be left with an odd looking list:

```
{
  firstName,
  lastName,
  location,
}
```

You can now change the paired delimiter by saying:

> `"box repack this"`

Success! Now we have a list of the keys.

```
[
  firstName,
  lastName,
  location,
]
```
