### Solution

Cursorless tracks your current selections using the `"this"`. So, if you ever need to add a selection to a current set of selections, you can use `"this"` to refer to the existing selections.

To solve this challenge, since `"param1"` and `"param2"` are selected, you could say `"take this and <mark>"` to select `"param3"`. From there, the command would be something like `"form snake at this"`.
