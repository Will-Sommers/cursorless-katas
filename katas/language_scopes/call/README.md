# Call

This should be short and sweet. Open up [call.js](./call.js) and notice we have a function definition and an invocation, or call.

Place your cursor within function and:

> Say `take funk`

Notice that the function has been highlighted.

Now, place your cursor anywhere within that function's invocation, `okOk();`.

> Say `take call`

Notice that the function's name and the following `"("` and `")"` are all highlighted.

That's it!
