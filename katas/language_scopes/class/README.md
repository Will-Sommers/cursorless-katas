# Class

Open up [class.js](./class.js) and take a look. Place your cursor within the class definition.

> Say `"take class"`

You'll notice that the class itself is highlighted. Deselect it and the try using a mark to address the class.

You make have read this within within [Items and Arguments](../items_and_arguments/) already but you can address the class' name easily by placing your cursor within the class.

> Say `"take class name"`

This will match the very first class it finds. Javascript doesn't allow for subclass definitions but for a language like Ruby or Java, the class closest to the mark will be returned.

That's it!
