# Head and Tail

The words modifiers `"head"` and `"tail"` can be used to create a selection from the cursor's position, through the beginning or end of the line, respectively. Open up [headTail.js](./headTail.js) and place your cursor anywhere in the middle of the line.

> Say `"take head"`

Move your cursor back to its original position.

> Say `"take tail"`

Great! If you want to pair scopes with range or line selections, take a look at the [Compound Targets](../../compound_targets/) katas.
