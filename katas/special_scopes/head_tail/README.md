# Head and Tail

The words modifiers `"head"` and `"tail"` can be used to create a selection from the cursor's position, through the beginning or end of the line, respectively. Open up [headTail.js](./headTail.js) and place your cursor anywhere in the middle of the line.

> Say `"take head"`

Move your cursor back to its original position.

> Say `"take tail"`

You'll see that in each case, the selection was expanded from the cursor to either the end of the beginning of the line. If you want to pair scopes with range or line selections, take a look at the [Compound Targets](../../compound_targets/) katas.
