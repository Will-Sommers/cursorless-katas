# Up and Down

Each of these modifiers are helpful when trying to select by cursor position. The modifier requires a number afterwards which will indicate how many lines the up or down Cursorless should look. Open [upAndDown.js](upAndDown.js) and place your cursor on line 7.

> Say `"take up 5"`
> Say `"take down 5"`

You can also pair this with language level scopes. Place your cursor on line 7 again.

> Say `"take funk up 5"`

If you're interested in addressing rows directly rather than offsets from your cursor position, check out the [Row](../row/) modifier. The `"up"` and `"down"` modifiers can be helpful though for quick selections near the cursor.
