# Word & Char

The "word" modifier allows you to address portion of a [token](../token/). Let's start by selecting a token;

Open `variousFormatting.js`. Find a mark within one of the variable names and say:

> `"take token <mark>`"

Now, let's use the `"word"` modifier. With the token selected say:

> `"change first word"`

You can pair this with ordinals. Try making changes to the variable name on line 5.

`"char"` words in a similar way. Let's delete the last character of one of the variables by saying:

> `"chuck last char <mark>"`

Right now, as of 4/21/22, you can'thist yet pair these together, so something like: `"chuck last char first word <mark>"`.
