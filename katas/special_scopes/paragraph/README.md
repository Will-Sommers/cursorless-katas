# Paragraph

Open up [paragraph.js](./paragraph.js).

Note, I've remapped this to be `"block"` as it is easier for me to say than `"paragraph'` Place your cursor on line 2 and then:

> Say `"take paragraph"`

Notice that the three lines are all selected.

Now place your cursor above `ok4` and issue the same command. Notice that only that line is highlighted.

What will happen when you place your cursor within `yar()` and issue the same command, `"take paragraph"`?

Notice that both that line as well as the line below containing the trailing bracket, `}`, from the function definition are selected.
